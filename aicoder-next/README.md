## 📖 Documentation

For detailed information about API integration and usage, see [API_INTEGRATION.md](./API_INTEGRATION.md).

For working with large codebases (5,000+ lines), see [LARGE_CODEBASES.md](./LARGE_CODEBASES.md).

## ⚡ Token Limits & Large Code Support

The app now supports **large codebases** with intelligent token management:

- **GPT-4o**: Up to ~6,000 lines of code
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Up to ~9,000 lines of code
- **Real-time token counter**: See exactly how much of your limit you're using
- **Smart warnings**: Get notified when approaching token limits
- **Model recommendations**: Suggestions for best models based on code size

💡 **Tip**: For files exceeding 5,000 lines, use Claude models or split your code into modules. See [LARGE_CODEBASES.md](./LARGE_CODEBASES.md) for detailed strategies.
